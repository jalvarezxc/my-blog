## Update On Descartes:

I finished reading Descartes' *Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy* a couple weeks ago, and I wanted to write down some things I took away from the text. First of all, I'm glad that I got to read some of Descarte's work - it was really cool to see where the famous line "I think, therefore I am" came from and in the proper context. It was also really cool to see his mind at work in the *meditations* portion of the book, where he very plainly stated his goal of questioning everything he had always thought to be true, including his own existance, and then going through the exercise in a surprisingly simple step-by-step process.

This reminded me of the fact that we can effectively see into the minds of people who lived thousands of years ago when reading very old texts, which is pretty amazing. I will probably write about this in a future post.
