## Tuesday Night:

Erica Albright is a bitch. Do you think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all BU girls are bitches? For the record, she may look like 34C but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret. She's a 34B, as in barely anything there. False advertising.

The truth is she has a nice face. I need to do something to take my mind off her. Easy enough, except I need an idea. 

I'm a little intoxicated. I'm not gonna lie. So what if it's not even 10pm and it's a Tuesday night. The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. Billy Olsen sitting here had the idea of putting some of the pictures next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter. Good call, Mr. Olsen! 

Yeah, it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hottness like they do on hotornot.com.

The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures. Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook, so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in. Let the hacking begin...
